#why?

To be honest, the sole reason this exists is because I got fed up of Blue Subscribers. I've never made a Chrome Extension before (sorry if it's bad), and I figured it was a fun thing to do. Plus the chance of Musk noticing this and getting annoyed, cherry on top.

#Performance Issues?

None that I can see, all it does is check if the tweet has the verified icon, if it does it marks it as display = none

#This is stupid, I can do this better

Submit a PR! I'll accept any that come along. Frankly I couldn't find this extension in my 2 minutes of searching, so I made it myself using ChatGPT, it really took no time at all. Feel free to make your own!

#Musk gave everyone over 1million followers a tick now I can't see my favourite tweeter

Ah well, might add a whitelist at some point if people actually start using it. So far it's just for my personal usage but I figured others might want it aswell.
